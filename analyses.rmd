title: "Analyses"
---

Apart from doing my job tasks, I try to find some spare time for econometrics and predictive modeling. Recently, I have analysed the results of the European parliamentary elections in Poland. I published the results of my analysis on [GitHub pages](https://jkubajek.github.io/EP2019/index) (the analysis is in polish).

Previously, I built predictive models on Lending Club dataset. The code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jkubajek/Lending_Club) and the summary on [GitHub pages](https://jkubajek.github.io/Lending_Club/index).
