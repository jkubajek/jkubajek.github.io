I am passionate about new technologies, like AI, but also about those well-established, such as econometrics. In AI field, I focus on NLP - I have participated in projects concerning text summarization, topic clustering, sentiment analysis and QA systems. Currently, I work as an NLP Trainee in Samsung R&D Poland.

In 2019, I graduated from [Warsaw School of Economics](http://www.sgh.waw.pl/en/Pages/default.aspx) with MS in quantitive methods. For my master thesis I created a multi-agent model of speculative bubble on cryptocurrency market. My thesis can be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331024979_Agent-based_analysis_of_the_cryptocurrency_speculative_bubble_Master_Thesis).

Before joining Samsung, I worked for the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland and did an internship in Ministry of Finance. My CV is available [here](files/CV_Jakub_Kubajek.pdf).
